## Two types of Information Gathering
1. Passive Information Gathering
	- To gain information of your target without interacting to the target itself
	- To rely mostly on open information or tools which do not require scanning the target system
2. Active Information Gathering
	- To proactively interact with the target to gain information
	- The gathering include port scanning and other tool usage, which might become illegal if done without permission
